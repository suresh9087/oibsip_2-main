NUMBER GUESSING GAME
____________________

The fun and easy project “Guess the Number” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:

1. The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.

2. The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.

3. The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.

4. The game continues under the user guessing the number.

You can also incorporate further details as:

5. Limiting the number of attempts.

6. Adding more rounds.

7. Displaying score.

8. Giving points based on the number of attempts.
